# Data-Augmentation

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular, has led to improvements in the speed of radiological image processing and diagnosis. This speed-up has not come at the price of accuracy; cutting-edge algorithms are comparable to the current standard of care. The best human experts still outperform AI, so the technologies being developed serve as a complement to doctors and researchers, not as their replacement. Thus, it's important that those using these new tools attain some familiarity with their inner workings.

One of the important parameters model should have in order to achive heigh accuracy is to be trained on a huge dataset, but the problem in the field of health care and medical images that its hard to collect so many data because of the privacy issue and also the amount of human experts to label this huge dataset.

By building a model and train the same model twise, once on the original dataset and another on augmented data with the original data and then showing and comparing the results both trained models I will show that developers can use data augmentation tichneques.
